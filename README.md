# Audio-File-conversion-.MP3-to-.wav

This file is easy to read and understand

There are 2 inputs that are asked from the user during the runtime - First will be the source path (directory where all the .mp3 files are present) and the second will be the destination path (directory where the converted .wav files are needed to be stored)

Open the .py file using any tools or cmd prompt and run it. After providing the inputs, the converted audio files will be generated in the destination path.

I have uploaded both .ipynb and .py files which can be executed.
If .ipynb file is opened, run the cells in the order as it is given.
